# multi-polar-isation

## Aims
This project aims to quantify the effects of a (poloidal) magnetic field topology on X-ray polarisation. This enables a more accurate understanding of the polarisation measurements of neutron star emission.

## Scope
- The geometric effect from an extended emission region will be taken into account.
- The emission region of the neutron star will be assumed to be as a blackbody for simplicity.
- The adiabatic approximation will be used to approximate the QED effects.
